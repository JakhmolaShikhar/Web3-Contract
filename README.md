It's a basic web3 app contract in this you may need to write more code according to the app you are building but i think this is the basic template everyone will need atleast.

First step, make a folder "folder name" then open the empty folder in your code editor, open terminal and copy paste this command 'npm install --save-dev hardhat' (remove the singel colon).
Then run 'npm install --save-dev ethereum-waffle'
and lastly run npx hardhat init
